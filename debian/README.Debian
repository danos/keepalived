keepalived for debian
---------------------

This package has been build against the 2.4.28 and 2.6.11
kernel headers as older kernels have buggy ipvs code.

So you need a newer kernel to get keepalived working properly.

See http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=4855643&forum_id=3211
and http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=5353482&forum_id=3211
for more information.

Keepalived will not work with debian default kernels.
